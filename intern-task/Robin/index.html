                  <strong>How Can I Get a Signed Book?</strong><br />
                  <br />I cannot sell you a book, because I'm a writer, not a
                  book shop!&nbsp; I do not have a supply of my own books
                  here.&nbsp;

                  But if you want a signed book, even one with a special
                  dedication, you can still get one.&nbsp; Even the 25th
                  anniversary edition of Assassin's Apprentice.<a

                  &nbsp;Oh, how I wish that writers could just make those things
                  happen! But that isn't how it works.&nbsp; Translations of
                  books happen when publishers come to my agent and say, "We
                  would like to translate that Hobb book and sell it in our
                  country." I have to wait and hope that a publisher will do
                  that. If you've enjoyed one of my books, and wish the
                  publisher would translate more of them, writing to the
                  publisher may encourage that to happen!

                  Movies/ TV series are the same.&nbsp; Making a movie or TV
                  series demands a large team of peoploe and a huge budget, and
                  many skills that I do not possess. &nbsp; I have to wait until
                  a production company is interested in doing that.

                  Sometimes I send out signed bookplates. If and when I am going

                  end date..&nbsp; I do not send them out year round, because
                  they are a project that demands time, attention, trips to the
                  post office and lots of postage stamps.&nbsp; If you come to a
                  signing, I often have extra bookplates with me and I am happy

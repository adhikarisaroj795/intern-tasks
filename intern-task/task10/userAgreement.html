            <p>
              This is the entire Agreement governing the use of the AppGames
              Site. No delay by either party shall waive rights under this
              Agreement. This Agreement is governed by, and to be construed in
              accordance with, the laws of the State of Connecticut, without
              regard to that state’s conflict of law’s provisions. By using the
              Site you expressly agree that personal jurisdiction and venue are
              proper exclusively in the state and federal courts located in the
              State of Connecticut. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement
              shall be a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, and no
              waiver shall be valid unless in writing signed by the parties. If
              any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, such provision
              shall be restated to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original
              intention of AppGames in accordance with applicable law and the
              remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force.
